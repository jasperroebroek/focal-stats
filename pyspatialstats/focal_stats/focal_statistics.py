    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array (2D)
    window : int, array_like, Window
        Window that is applied over ``a``. It can be an integer or a sequence of integers, which will be interpreted as
        a rectangular window, a mask or a Window object.
    fraction_accepted : float, optional
        Fraction of valid cells (not NaN) per window that is deemed acceptable
        ``0``: all window are calculated if at least 1 value is present
        ``1``: only windows completely filled with values are calculated
        ``0-1``: fraction of acceptability
    verbose : bool, optional
        Verbosity with timing. False by default
    reduce : bool, optional
        The way in which the windowed array is created. If true, all values are used exactly once. If False (which is
        the default), values are reduced and the output array has the same raster_shape as the input array, albeit with a
        border of nans where there are not enough values to calculate the cells.

    Returns
    -------
    :obj:`~numpy.ndarray`

            numpy ndarray of the function applied to input array ``a``. The raster_shape will
